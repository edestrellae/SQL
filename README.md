# SQL
This repository contains a collection of SQL queries based on exercises inspired by the book Sams Teach Yourself SQL in 10 Minutes by Ben Forta. To demonstrate my SQL skills, I asked ChatGPT to generate a set of 18 questions related to a toy company's database. The provided SQL file includes both the questions and their solutions, showcasing various SQL techniques such as:

Data Retrieval: Using SELECT statements to fetch specific data.
Filtering Data: Applying WHERE clauses to filter records.
Joining Tables: Using JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables.
Aggregation: Using GROUP BY and aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, and AVG.
Subqueries: Utilizing nested queries to perform complex data retrieval.
